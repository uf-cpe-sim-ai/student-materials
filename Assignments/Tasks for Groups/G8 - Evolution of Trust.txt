First, play "The Evolution of Trust" (https://ncase.me/trust/). In this activity, you will reflect on it.

Have you seen the archetypes in existing games? Talk about how these behaviors impact your decision making. Does your behavior come close to any of these?

Now, think about trust from a designer's perspective. How can we use different models of trust and behavior to elicit reactions (whichever ones we want - happiness, anger, etc) from players?
