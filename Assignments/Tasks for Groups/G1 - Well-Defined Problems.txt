A) Brainstorm a list of 5-10 interesting well defined problems, whether from games, simulations, or life. (E.g.: path planning; 8-puzzle; other 1-player games or puzzles - not 2-player games!) Narrow down one problem to focus on. Identify the key parts of the problem:

1) What makes up a problem state (accumulation of changes)?
2) What is the state space for the problem and goal state(s)?
3) What finite, unambiguous set of operators act on the states?

B) Describe how you would solve the problem. How would the problem state be represented? The operators? How would you avoid duplicate states? Put together a brief summary of as before (poster / slides / etc).
