A) Explore the following systems. Let them run for a bit:

https://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/
https://rednuht.org/genetic_walkers/
https://rednuht.org/geneticat/
https://rednuht.org/genetic_brick_cars/
https://chriscummins.cc/s/genetics/

Briefly discuss these with your group members. Anything interesting?

B) Design a simulation or game mechanic that could use a GA. Identifyâ€¦

1) What would the solutions - i.e., chromosomes - be?
2) How would the genes be defined (sub-parts of the chromosomes)?
3) What would the fitness function measure? (Sketch it out.)
4) What selection / mutation / recombination processes is best, & why?
