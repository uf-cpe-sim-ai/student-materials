Design a simulation (game or otherwise) that utilizes steering behaviors other than flocking. Discuss how the behaviors could be used to build / enhance gameplay and mechanics; how it would impact player decisions; and how the agents would interact with the environment. Are the behaviors uniform, or do they vary by agent / group? Are they controlled by the player, or do they respond to the player / environment? What makes the steering behavior unique / useful / interesting in this context?
